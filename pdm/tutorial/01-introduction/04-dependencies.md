# Our first installable module

We are now ready to start developing our package.
To start with, we'll add a runnable module inside our package (we'll soon have a better way of testing whether our code works).
Specifically, we'll add a Python module that fetches the PyCon US programme, parses it and prints out the immediate next sessions (which it does to help us check if the code works, later, we'll look at unit tests for a better way to check this.)

## Exercises
1. Create a file `pycon.py` in the `src/{{package name}}` directory (replace `package name` with the name of your package) and copy the contents of [`code/packaging-tutorial/src/packaging_tutorial/pycon.py`](../../code/packaging-tutorial/src/packaging_tutorial/pycon.py) into it. You do not need to understand the code - this is just an example to show how we can package our code.
2. Run the command `pdm install` in the same terminal window you used to run `pdm init`. You should get a few lines of output, among them the line `Virtualenv is created successfully at {{path to your package}}\.venv` and `ðŸŽ‰ All complete!`.
3. Run this file by typing `pdm run python src/{{package_name}}/pycon.py` in your terminal emulator (replace `{{package name}}` with the name of your package). What happened?
4. Add httpx as a dependency to your project by running `pdm add httpx`
5. Open the `pyproject.toml` file. Can you find httpx anywhere in that file?
6. Try to run the `pycon.py` file again

## Reflection

When we tried to run the script above, we got an `ImportError` because we hadn't installed HTTPX first.
This is great since we want to have full control over what packages we need to install to run our code.
Otherwise, it would be very difficult for others to use it!
We should have all this information about what we need to run our code in the `pyproject.toml`-file and let PDM take care of installing and managing the dependencies.
We could manually add the dependencies to the `pyproject.toml`-file.
However, instead we used PDM handy way for adding dependencies and installing dependencies at the same time: `pdm add`.
In fact, when you ran `pdm add httpx`, three things happened: PDM checked if you could add HTTPX as a dependency, then it updated the `pyproject.toml` file before it installed HTTPX in the virtual environment for your project.
You could do all of this manually as well.

Before we move on, we can make a little script to check if we can install our library.

## Exercises

1. Create a new folder in your project root (i.e. outside of `src`) called `scripts`, and create a new file `get_charlas.py` into it. Copy the contents of [`code/packaging-tutorial/scripts/get_charlas.py`](../../code/packaging-tutorial/scripts/get_charlas.py) into it (you may need to modify the `import packaging_tutorial.pycon`-import, replacing `packaging_tutorial` with the name of the directory inside `src`) and run it. What did it do?
2. Discuss with your neighbour: why do you think the import in the `get_charlas.py`-script worked?

<img src="../../../assets/post_it_yellow.svg" alt="Illustration of a pink post it note" width="50px" />

## Reflection
The reason the import in the `get_charlas.py`-script worked was that when we ran `pdm install` in exercise 2, our package was installed into our virtual environment (more about virtual environments later).
This means we can import the code as any other package you have installed!
Importantly, when you set up a project with pdm, it is installed in a way so any change in `src/{{package_name}}` is automatically included in the imported code.
This is called an *editable install*, and the process was standardised in [PEP 660](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/) and is described well in the [Setuptools documentation](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html).

Now that we have tested that we can import our code, we are ready to add a couple of dependencies and improve it a little bit further.

## Exercises

1. Open the `pyproject.toml` file and manually add `pydantic` to the dependencies.
2. Replace the code in your `pycon.py`-file with the code from the [`code/packaging-tutorial/src/packaging_tutorial/validated_pycon.py`](../../code/packaging-tutorial/src/packaging_tutorial/validated_pycon.py) file from this repository and run the code with `pdm run python scripts/get_charlas.py`. What happened, and why did this happen?
3. Install the dependencies by running `pdm install` and try to run the `scripts/get_charlas.py` file again. What happened now?

## Reflection
So we see that we can add dependencies to the `pyproject.toml` file manually, which is very useful when we want to set up a template for others to use.
Still, we recommend that you use `pdm add` in most cases. It's a one-step process that ensures that you get a compatible set of dependencies.
Note that PDM will try to add the latest version of a given dependency that is compatible with the rest of your dependencies, which means that the order in which you add dependencies can matter (but 99% of the time, it won't matter).

# Optional reading: Dependency compatibility

## Exercises

1. Remove the `pydantic` dependency by running `uv remove pydantic`
2. Use whichever method you prefer to add dependencies to your project and try to add and install the following two dependencies (remember the versions!):

Â  Â  * `"pydantic<2"`
Â  Â  * `"pydantic-settings==2.1.0"`

<img src="../../../assets/post_it_yellow.svg" alt="Illustration of a pink post it note" width="50px" />

## Reflection
As you may have noticed, PDM spent a while saying `â ™ Resolving dependencies` before saying

```raw
ðŸ”’ Lock failed
Unable to find a resolution for pydantic
because of the following conflicts:
 pydantic<2 (from project)
 pydantic>=2.3.0 (from pydantic-settings@2.1.0)
To fix this, you could loosen the dependency version constraints in pyproject.toml. See
https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/usage/dependency/#solve-the-locking-failure for more details.
```

This means that you have two dependencies that are *incompatible*.
Specifically, you want to add [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) with a version less than 2.0.0.
However, all versions of [Pydantic settings](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/) with version greater than or equal to 1.0 requires Pydantic version 2 or greater.
This will clearly not work: you cannot have both have a Pydantic version less than 2 and Pydantic version greater than or equal to 2!

A nice feature of PDM is that it will check this for us so we don't accidentally end up with incompatible dependencies for our project.
If you use `pdm add`, it takes it one step further and tries to find a compatible dependency to add to your project.
So when you tried to run `"pdm add pydantic<2" "pydantic-settings>=1"`, PDM tried to find versions the dependencies that were compatible (with each other and already existing dependencies.)
This was not possible for `"pydantic-settings>=1"` and `"pydantic<2"`.
Luckily though, we don't rely on any outdated Pydantic features, so we can upgrade to Pydantic 2

## Exercises
1. Remove the pydantic and pydantic-settings dependencies from the `pyproject.toml` file. Add them again by typing `pdm add pydantic pydantic-settings`.
2. Replace the code in your `pycon.py`-file with the code from the [`code/packaging-tutorial/src/packaging_tutorial/validated_pycon_with_config.py`](../../code/packaging-tutorial/src/packaging_tutorial/validated_pycon_with_config.py). How does this file differ from the original `pycon.py`-file?
3. Test that the code works by running the `get_charlas`-script with `pdm run python scripts/get_charlas.py`

## Reflection

The easiest way to resolve dependency problems is to try to delete all of your clashing dependencies and add them again.
This can work because PDM will try to find the latest compatible version of your dependencies.
Thus, if you don't have any special requirements for your dependencies, then this approach can work.
However, if you for some reason absolutely MUST have a specific version of your dependencies, then you might be out of luck.

## Aside: dependencies in libraries and applications
Dependency compatibility is tricky business.
Generally, you want your *applications* to have completely fixed versions in the listed dependencies and your *libraries* to have as unconstrained versions as possible in the listed dependencies.
The reason for this difference is that we we want full control over the libraries we use in applications we develop (e.g. to avoid supply chain attacks) but we don't want to mandate which versions consumers of our libraries should use.
Managing versions is easier for dependencies that strictly adhers to [*semantic versioning (semver)*](https://semver.org/).
In those cases, you can change the dependencies in the `pyproject.toml`-file from `library==X.Y.Z` to `library>=X.Y,<X+1` (e.g. `httpx>=0.26,<1`).
However, strictly adhering to semver is difficult, and most libraries don't do this.
In this case, you can just removethe version pin altogether in the dependency list (or use `>=`-pins).
For example, you may use `httpx` or `httpx>=0.26.0` instead of `httpx==0.26.0`.
